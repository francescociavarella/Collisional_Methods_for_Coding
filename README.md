# Collisional_Methods_for_Coding
Simulation of **Excitonic transport** dynamics in a **excitonic dimer** using a stochastic unraveling approach based on **Collisional Methods**, both in **Quantum Jump** and **Difussive Limits**.
The results are validated through a comparison with the dynamics derived from the **Lindblad Master Equation**. Furthermore, the collisional evolution is benchmarked against the **Isolated System** dynamics (i.e., purely unitary evolution without the collisional interaction).

## Initial Configuration
To replicate the results clone the repository and recreate the Conda enviroment, to ensure all required libraries are installed.

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/francescociavarella/Collisional_Methods_for_Coding.git
   cd Collisional_Methods_for_Coding
    ```
2. **Create the Enviroment wit Conda**
    ```
    conda env create -f enviroment.yml
    ```
3. **Activate Enviroment**
    ```
    conda avtivate mc
    ```
Now you are ready to navigate the repository and run the notebooks.

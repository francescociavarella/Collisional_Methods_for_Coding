# Collisional_Methods_for_Coding
Simulation of **Excitonic transport** dynamics in a **excitonic dimer** using a stochastic unraveling approach based on **Collisional Methods**, both in **Quantum Jump** and **Difussive Limits**.
The results are validated through a comparison with the dynamics derived from the **Lindblad Master Equation**. Furthermore, the collisional evolution is benchmarked against the **Isolated System** dynamics (i.e., purely unitary evolution without the collisional interaction).
